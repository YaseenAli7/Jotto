# Jotto
Jotto is an early predecessor to the hit game “Wordle,” with slight variation in  the rules of the game. Essentially, a five-letter word is chosen within the program, and the user has 6 guesses, with each guess receiving feedback. This continues for 3 words, and after three rounds the user is given a score and possibly placed on a leaderboard.

HOW TO PLAY:
Copy/Paste or clone the repository to your IDE. Run it.
Enter an option from the main menu; 1 to play, 2 to view the scoreboard, 3 to exit the program.
When you begin playing the game, round 1 will begin. Enter a 5 letter word of only letters. 
If you enter numbers or characters instead, input validation will prevent the string from being validated, and you will be prompted again while still on your first try.
You have 6 tries per round, and 3 total rounds, which are different words.
Once you complete all guesses for a round, you will recieve the number of points recieeved for that round.
Once you complete all rounds, you will recieve your total score and if you scored high enough, your placement on the leaderboard.
